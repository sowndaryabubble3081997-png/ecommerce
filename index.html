    <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, is a technology that enables computers and machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making. AI systems learn from data to recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt to new inputs without being explicitly programmed for every task. Examples include virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.  
Mimics human intelligence: AI allows machines to simulate human cognitive tasks like comprehension, problem-solving, and creativity. 
Learns from data: A key aspect of AI is its ability to learn from vast amounts of data to improve its performance over time. 
Performs tasks: It can perform a wide range of tasks, from understanding and translating language to analyzing data and making complex decisions. 
Common applications: AI is used in many everyday technologies, including search engines, virtual assistants (like Siri and Alexa), and recommendation engines on platforms like Netflix and Amazon. 
Aims for a broad application: Wsthile many AI applications are currently "narrow," focusing on specific tasks, the long-term goal is to create systems with broader human-like flexibility and intelligence.

It involves creating systems that can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions without explicit step-by-step instructions. </p>        <h2>good morning</h2>
