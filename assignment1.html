    <meta property="og:description" content="artificial intelligence, is a technology that enables computers and machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making. AI systems learn from data to recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt to new inputs without being explicitly programmed for every task. Examples include virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.
